# odin-recipes
The Odin Project (Project: Recipes)

This is a simple html exercise with the end goal of creating boilerplate website that has information on several food recipes.

## Things I've Learned
* Creating a boilerplate HTML
* Using correct formating for readability
* Using different heading to create organization of ideas
* Adding links and images to a page
* Using ordered and unordered lists
* Cloning a Git repo, adding and commiting, and pushing
