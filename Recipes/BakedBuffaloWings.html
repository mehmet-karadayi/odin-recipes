    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The beauty of baked buffalo chicken wings is that you can get the same, 
            crispy texture without the need for splattering hot fryer oil. Using our 
            handy baking powder trick and a wire rack, they get a wonderful crust with 
            a fraction of the fat of deep-fried versions. Tossing the crispy wings together 
            with a buttery, tangy buffalo sauce is irresistibly good.
