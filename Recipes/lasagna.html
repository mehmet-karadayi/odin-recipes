        <p>
            Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. 
            It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, 
            made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. 
            After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed 
            in layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions.
