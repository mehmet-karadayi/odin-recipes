        <p>
            Traditional macaroni and cheese is a casserole baked in the oven; however, 
            it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix.  
            The cheese is often first incorporated into a BÃ©chamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, 
            which is then added to the pasta. In the United States, it is considered a comfort food.
